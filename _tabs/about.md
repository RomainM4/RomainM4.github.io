I’m **Romain Mollé**, a passionate developer specialized in .NET Core 8 & C, currently based near Nantes from France. I have a strong background in software engineering, cybersecurity, and Windows internals. My focus is on **building robust, secure, and scalable solutions** — from clean architecture web APIs to system-level automation.

I gained solid experience at [Orange Cyberdéfense](https://www.orangecyberdefense.com), working on Active Directory automation and security. Currently, I am an R&D developer at [SITACI](https://www.sitaci.fr/),  where I work on innovative projects in warehouse management and logistics, mainly using Delphi.

My self-learning journey began with C# and .NET Framework — building licensing systems and even contributing to a game emulator for Nostale. Over the years, I’ve expanded into C/C++, assembly, and reverse engineering. I’m comfortable working with complex systems, technical transitions, and always strive for elegant, maintainable code.

I am fluent in French and English, and quick to adapt to any development environment. Whether it’s collaborating on major cybersecurity projects or bringing a new product idea to life, I bring dedication, curiosity, and a proactive mindset to every mission.

When I'm not coding, you’ll likely find me on a wakeboard, a snowboard, or watching documentaries on nature or cybersecurity.



**Let’s work together to build efficient, secure, and innovative software.**
