  Nostale Clientless WebController
  <br>
</h1>

**Nostale Clientless WebController** is an application built with **.NET Core 8**. The main objective is to offer a flexible and scalable way to interact with Nostale game servers without needing a traditional game client, leveraging modern backend technologies and container orchestration.

## Solution Structure

The solution consists of several projects:

- **NosCore.Worker**:  
  A background service implementing a clientless Nostale interaction logic.

- **NosCore.ClientApi**:  
  Allows sending actions to the Worker using MassTransit via RabbitMQ.

- **NosCore.GameAuthenticationApi**:  
  Handles authentication with GameForge and retrieves the necessary authentication token to access Nostale servers.

- **NosCore.Contracts**:  
  Contains communication contracts between the Worker and ClientApi.

- **NosCore.Tcp**:  
  A TCP client with socks5 proxy support.

- **NosCore.Packet**:  
  Houses all game packets for Nostale.

- **NosCore.Sdk**:  
  Contains shared elements used by the Worker.

- **NosCore.AppHost**:  
  Deploys the whole solution with initial setup. RabbitMQ is started and managed via Docker.

---

## Internal Project Workflow

- The project relies on **.NET Aspire** and **Docker** for orchestration.
- Aspire automatically deploys all projects and spins up a RabbitMQ Docker machine for inter-service communication.

## How to Run the Project

To get Nostale Clientless WebController running:

1. **Update Your Client Information**  
   - In `NosCore.Worker.Services.Client.ClientSession.SendLoginCredentials()`, update:
     - `versionNostaleClientX` with the current Nostale client version.
     - `hashNostaleClients` with the latest client hash.
     - *Note*: GameForge occasionally changes some fields, such as adding extra spaces, so keep an eye on those!

2. **Get Your GameForge Authentication Token**  
   - Use a packet logger to intercept the authentication packet sent when switching servers.
   - Extract the token from this packet.

3. **Login with the Token**  
   - Use the token with the `ClientApi` (Web API) using the `/LOGIN` endpoint.
