**NosFarm** is a project I started to simplify and automate the management of multiple [Nostale](https://www.nostale.gameforge.com/) accounts in a clientless way. While development is now paused, I want to share the core ideas behind the project, the structure, and the challenges I faced along the journey.

## Project Overview

NosFarm was designed as an **admin panel** which would allow you to control and monitor several Nostale accounts simultaneously, directly from a centralized interface. The goal was to manage connected accounts with customizable "jobs," each defining specific automated behaviors.

---

## Application Architecture

The application is split into multiple **service layers** to organize features and responsibilities:

### Service Layer 1

- `CaptchaSrv`: Stores the Gameforge captcha and allows users to submit solutions.
- `CountrySrv`: Manages supported countries and their flags.
- `IdentitySrv`: Handles the identification required to connect to Gameforge accounts (blackbox).
- `PluginSrv`: Manages user control plugins for the client.
- `ProviderAuthSrv`: Handles connecting, creating, and deleting Gameforge accounts.
- `ProviderSrv`: Generates Gameforge authentication tokens required for Nostale login.

### Service Layer 2

- `ClientSrv (IClient)`: Handles clientless control of an individual Nostale account.
- `FarmSrv (IFarm)`: Manages multiple `IClient` instances via user-supplied control plugins.

---

## Automation: Plugins & State Machines

NosFarm leverages the **Nodify** library to build a flexible StateMachine for controlling each client through a system of pluggable "nodes."

### Example Plugins

- `DefaultNodesPlugin`: Provides essential nodes like `EntryPoint`, `WorldSelection`, and `Endpoint`.
- `WalkPlugin`: Contains the `Walk` node (not implemented yet).

These plugins allow users to craft decision trees that automate complex behaviors:

- **EntryPoint** manages the Nostale account login.
- **WorldSelection** connects an account to a server and a specific channel.

---

## Project Status and Drawbacks

NosFarm is **currently abandoned** due to technical limitations and changing priorities:

- **Hardcoded Paths**: There are several file paths (database, plugins directory, logs, etc.) that must be adapted for the project to work on a new environment.
- **Incomplete Features**: Some plugins or nodes, like `Walk`, remain unimplemented.

---

## Conclusion

The ultimate goal of NosFarm was to enable **centralized, automated, and simultaneous management of multiple Nostale accounts**, with every account running a dedicated "job" describing its behavior.

Even though the project is on hold, I believe it provides a valuable base for those interested in game automation or multi-account management systems. Its modular approach and early implementation concepts could serve as inspiration or foundation for similar projects.
